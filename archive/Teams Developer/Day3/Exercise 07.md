* **NOTE**: *There is a current bug in the distinct select statement in CosmosDB Logic App integrations. Until this is resolved the initial step will be 'hard coded.'*    
The final Logic App will execute a stored procedure. The initial portion will do a UDF query to get the all the skills into a simple JSON structure. The second portion of the query will find the count of users that match those skills. If the count of users is greater than 1 then create a new channel with the matched skill in the newly created Team.    
* Add a new **Initialize variable** step 
    * Set the **Name** to responsibilites
    * Set the **Type** to Array
    * Set the Value to the following
        ```json
        [

          "JavaScript",
          "C#",
          ".Net Core"
        ]
        ```
* Add a new **For Each** step
    * Set the output from previous steps as [responsibilities]
    * Add a **Cosmos DB Query documents** V3 step
    * Set the **Database ID** to the Icebreaker database
    * Set the **Collection ID** to UserProfiles
    * Set the **SQL Syntax Query** to look like the following
