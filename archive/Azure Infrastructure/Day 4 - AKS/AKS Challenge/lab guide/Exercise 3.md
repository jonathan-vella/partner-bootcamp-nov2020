# Challenge Guide

## Operationalizing Azure Kubernetes Service

## Challenge 3: Monitoring containerized workloads

Now that your applications are up and running on their new infrastructure, it is time to implement a solution for monitoring cluster, node, pod, and container health.

Fruit Smashers would like to implement:

- A dedicated dashboard for each application team which shows them common AKS performance metrics such as:
    - Overall cluster health
    - CPU consumption per node
    - Pod health
- A dedicated workbook for their own Ops team which allows for filtering by:
    - Node pool in the AKS cluster
        - For each node pool, the pods that are running on the node should be displayed

## Success criteria

Demonstrate to your coach:

- The dashboards you developed for the application teams. Explain how those dashboards will be shared between members of an application team.
- The workbook you developer for the Ops team.
