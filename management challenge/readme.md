# Management Challenge


We are delivering a challenge focused on enabling Arc enabled servers (simulated in Microsoft Azure).

The goal is to get attendees to enable the Arc management agent on their virtual machines, enable a policy and then delegate access to their subscription with one of the peers in their groups.

The content is hosted here: [Management Challenge](https://github.com/opsgility/arc-enabled-servers-hack)

Attendees will each have to activate an Azure pass to complete the challenge.

A trainer guide will be posted here ASAP.
